START DEVELOPING!
OUR TUTORIAL:
1. Enter desired location and clone project 
    Terminal:
        git clone git@github.com:hh15248/web4.0-Django.git

2. cd into the folder and run the project
    Terminal:
        cd web4.0-django/my_demo
        python manage.py runserver
        Note: your command may be python3 manage.py runserver

        copy and paste the url from the output in your browser to view the webapp
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. Add yourself as a superuser to view Bevo's admin page
    Terminal:
        (Ctrl+C to Quit)
        python manage.py createsuperuser

    fill out respective fields (email not necessary)

    Run the demo in terminal and pull up website:
        python manage.py runserver
    
    Add "admin/" to the base url and login to easily view the database info
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

4. Add the best_school field to bevo's contact model and form
    Uncomment lines in the contact direcotry in forms.py and models.py

    Change the database in the terminal:

        python manage.py migrate
    
    Rerun to view new changes in terminal:
        python manage.py runserver

5. Edit bevo's about page HTML file in templates
    While the website is still up (no Ctrl+C !), navigate to the about.html file

    Add necessary info like "I am orange and like to play in fields" to
        the file and save your edits with Ctrl+s
    
    No need to rerun from the terminal or migrate-- just refresh your website
    (If you quit the server just rerun django-admin runserver in the terminal to view changes)
